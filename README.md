# Todo-REST-GO

## Description: Only a simple Todo REST API
## Project only for my Go learning purpose.

## Progression
- [x] Basic Server 
- [x] GET Todo Router
- [x] POST Todo Router
- [x] PUT Todo Router
- [x] DELETE Todo Router
- [x] Massive DELETE Todo
- [x] The frontend (for the use of API)

## Setup
1. Change allowed origins for CORS at `routes/routes.go` file (in `AllowCORS` function.)
2. Change port if needed (in `main.go`.)
3. Done.

## Running
- Run the server with `go run main.go` command.

## Changed
- PATCH Router + Mark as done -> Massive Delete + another DELETE route
